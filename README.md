# PassStack  

**PassStack** is a SwiftUI component inspired by Apple’s Wallet app for creating interactive, animated pass stacks. It provides smooth animations, seamless transitions, and a visually engaging way to display passes.

## Features  
✅ Animated pass stacking and transitions  
✅ Smooth selection and deselection effects   
✅ Customizable styling and interaction logic  

## Implementing the Pass Stack  
Use `WalletView` as a basis to learn how to display and manage passes:  

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        WalletView()
    }
}
```

`WalletView` provides an example implementation of `PassStackView`, handling pass selection, animation, and customization.
