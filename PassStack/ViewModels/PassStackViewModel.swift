/// A view model responsible for managing and displaying a stack of passes in ``PassStackView``.
///
/// `PassStackViewModel` provides logic for handling pass selection, visibility, positioning,
/// scaling, and effects such as blur and opacity. It enables smooth transitions between passes
/// and maintains the correct index references for animations and interactions.
///
/// - Note: This class is intended to be used with a SwiftUI view that visualizes a stack of passes.
class PassStackViewModel: ObservableObject {

    /// Retrieves the index of a given pass within the pass stack.

    /// - Parameter pass: The `Pass` instance to find in the stack.

    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - pass: The `Pass` to determine opacity for.
    ///   - index: The index of the pass in the stack.
    ///   - selectedPass: The currently selected `Pass`, or `nil` if no pass is selected.

    ///   - displayScale: The scaling factor applied when passes are in transition.
